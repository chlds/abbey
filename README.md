### Building a library for WSL running on x86-64
A library based on UTF-8  

### Commentary
Any of the variadic functions in the library that return a single pointer containing the addresses of multiple character pointers must end its arguments with a NULL pointer.  
Any of the variadic functions in the library that return a single pointer containing the addresses of multiple integer pointers shall include in the first argument the number of its arguments to be entered from the second argument.  

### Coding Guidelines
Local variables are named using a single letter.  
Functions are named using word abbreviations.  
In principle, but there are exceptions.  

### Remarks
**Please note that the library is currently under construction and may be subject to frequent and significant changes.**
